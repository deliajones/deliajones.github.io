				<p>We know about Hubble and its well-earned reputation as the world's first space-based optical telescope. But other space telescopes are bringing us equally spectacular portfolios of celestial objects and events.</p>

		        <p div="intro">The Chandra X-ray Observatory was named in honor of Nobel Prize-winning Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and launched in June 1999. Chandra was specially designed to detect X-ray emissions from very hot regions of the universe such as exploded stars, clusters of galaxies, and matter around black holes.</p>

				<h3>Herschel</h3>
				<p>Built and operated by the European Space Agency, the Herschel Space Observatory was launched in 2009 and was named after Sir William Herschel who discovered the infrared spectrum. Herschel's major objective was discovering how the first galaxies formed and how they evolved to give rise to present day galaxies like our own. Herschel's operations concluded in 2013 after it depleted its coolant supply.</p>

				<h3>Spitzer</h3>
				<p>The Spitzer Space Telescope is an infrared space observatory launched in 2003. Drifting in a unique Earth-trailing orbit around the Sun, Spitzer sees an optically invisible universe dominated by dust and stars. It's helium coolant ran out in 2009, but two modules of the camera are still ooperable and will continue to be used in the Spitzer Warm Mission.</p>
