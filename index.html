				<p>You know about Hubble. We all know about Hubble and its well-earned reputation as the world’s first space-based optical telescope. But other space telescopes are bringing us equally spectacular portfolio of celestial objects and events. This site looks at images from Chandra, Spitzer and Herschel.</p>

                	<h3>Chandra</h3>
                		<p>The Chandra X-ray Observatory was named in honor of Nobel Prize–winning Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. It launchd in June 1999.1 Chandra is a X-ray telescope designed to observe remote objects in the X-ray spectrum. In order to get above the Earth's atmosphere. X-ray telescopes must be mounted on high altitude rockets or artificial satellites.2</p>

					<h3>Herschel</h3>
						<p>Built and operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), the Herschel Space Observatory was launched in 2009 and was named after Sir William Herschel, the discoverer of the infrared spectrum. Herschel's major objective was discovering how the first galaxies formed and how they evolved to give rise to present day galaxies like our own. In June 2013 Herschel’s operations were concluded after it depleted its coolant supply as was expected as part of the mission.</p>

					<h3>Spitzer</h3>
						<p>The Spitzer Space Telescope is an infrared space observatory launched in 2003. The mission could extend to five or slightly more years until the onboard liquid helium supply was exhausted – which happened in 2009.[4] Without liquid helium to cool the telescope to the very low temperatures needed to operate, most of the instruments are no longer usable. However, the two modules of the camera are still operable with the same sensitivity will continue to be used in the Spitzer Warm Mission.<sup>5</sup></p>
